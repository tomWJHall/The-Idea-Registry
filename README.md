This Java project is a simple software that allows users to create, store, and check their projects. 

A project can be store as one of 2 types: An Embedded System (ES), or an Application (App).
The projects are stored in the text file appSynthesis.txt at the root of the project, and each one is stored as: [[Name of the project], [Type of project], [Descirption of the project], [Level of importance of this project]].

This program, kept within one Java file, was started in late December 2021, done in about 4 days, and updated in a few hours on the 22nd of November 2022.
